- A directed graph is a pair of sets:
	- Vertex set, which contains the vertices or nodes.
	- Edge set, where each edge is an ordered pair of vertices.

#### Notes
Frankly, if you know how to read an arrow then you know what digraphs are. Edge sets are in order of the direction (an edge (3, 2) indicates 3--->2). I don't think a diagram is necessary since this is a large part of future sections.

You can have "loops" on a vertex where the edge set is itself (3,3).
